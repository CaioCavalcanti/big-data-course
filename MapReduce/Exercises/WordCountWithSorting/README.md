# Word Count with sorting
The objective of this project is to show how to sort the results generated by the MapReduce process.

The map process always sorts the results based on the keys. To change it to sort by the word count, we need to execute a new job to read the results, invert the key-value pairs, turning the word count as key.

## Prerequisites
TODO

## How does it work?
1) The first job reads a text file and count how many times each word appears on the document, resulting in a file with the following format:
```ssh
word1 1
word2 3
word3 2
word4 5
word5 1
```

2) After that, it calls the second job, that will read the result from the first job and sort it, based on the count, resulting in a file with the following format:
```ssh
5 word4
3 word2
2 word3
1 word5
1 word1
```

### Important
This project wasn't created by me. I just used the project WordCount as an example and added the sorting job.
